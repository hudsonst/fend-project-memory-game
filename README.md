## Objective

This is an interactive version of the classic "Concentration" card game.

The objective is to match all cards as quickly as possible with as few moves as possible.

## Instructions

To begin play, click on any card. The card will turn over. Click on a second card to turn over. If the cards match, they'll change color and remain facing up. If they don't match, they will turn back over.

Players start with three stars. After 30 moves, one star is lost. After 60 moves, two stars are lost, and after 90 moves the Player earns no stars.

When all the cards are matched, a message will pop up telling the Player how many stars they've earned, how many moves it took them to win, and how long it took them to win. There will also be a message inviting them to play again.

There is a reset button if the Player would like to start over.
